Interesting facts about me: I like games, food, sleep, coding, learning about life, walking, and most of all, gazing at the sky.

Recruiters: Feel free to check out my repositories and leave feedback on my LinkedIn. I would greatly appreciate it.

Developers: I love learning, but what I enjoy most is making new friendships. Let's play some games or code togetherâ€”whatever works!"
